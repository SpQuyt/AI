              <center>Digital Transformation in Education</center>
            </b></h1>
          <center><img class="img-3" src="images/digital transformation/Areas.png"></center>
          <p>
            <center><i>Digitization (the conversion), Digitalization (the process) and the digital transformation
                (the effect) therefore accelerate and illuminate the already existing and ongoing horizontal and global
                processes of change in society.</i></center>
          </p>
          <p>Digital Transformation appears in all most areas of our world; it exists in education, health,
            entertainment, telecommunications, financial services, etc. Actually, talking about digital transformation
            is very broad. We will talk specifically in two sectors: education and business to see how DT affect each
            one.</p>
          <h4><b>Why we need Digital Transformation in Education sector ?</b></h4>
          <p>In fact, from virtual classrooms to mobile learning apps, collaborative learning to regularly upgrading
            teacher skills, digital transformations have brought about unprecedented changes to the modern education
            system.<br /> <br>
            Unfortunately, most institutions have yet to transform the core administrative processes and tasks at the
            heart of their operations. The majority of these day-to-day tasks from student enrollment to purchase
            requisitions to absence requests are still performed using paper- or email-based processes that offer zero
            flexibility and an enormous amount of wasted time
          </p>
          <p>Modern digital tools and technologies such as visual, low-code platforms, can help schools easily automate
            internal processes, streamline routine activities and enhance communication between students, teachers and
            parents. We’re talking about large efficiency improvements that could change what employees do every day.
            It could make a fundamental difference by allowing educators to focus on students rather than paperwork</p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>Are we ready for bringging Digital Transformation into “old” Education system ?</b></h4>
          <p>People tend to get used to doing things in a certain way and are reluctant to leave their comfort zone.
            When we have to adopt a new technology or system, we are afraid of failure and reluctant to learn new
            skills or processes. The very first step is to ensure that your employees clearly understand the benefits
            of such changes.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>Talent gap</b></h4>
          <p>Skills are at the core of innovation. A lack of resources or expertise has emerged as the biggest
            challenge in digital transformation. Educational institutions must compete for increasingly scarce talent
            in a variety of areas from user experience to security to cloud..</p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>Legacy integration</b></h4>
          <p>Existing legacy systems are often crucial to processes in organizations; however, modern web-based
            business applications do not guarantee compatibility with them. That’s where organizations hit a roadblock
            and are forced to spend more for either an upgrade or custom integration..</p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>Where do we start ?</b></h4>
          <p>This is the most crucial challenge when it comes to translating strategy into a concrete plan of action.
            “Where to start?” is the key factor for success. Identify a business process that’s not too simple or too
            complex and has reasonable volume, and be sure to understand the time and effort required to digitally
            transform it.</p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>Where do we start ?</b></h4>
          <p>Like most organizations, data in educational institutions is siloed. Questions of accuracy and reliability
            really come into play. Which data did you use to implement new processes for the future? Which data set is
            used to make an impactful business decision? You need salient, timely and precise data to make informed
            decisions.</p>
          <p>The future of technology in education has absolutely nothing to do with technology. It has everything to
            do with leadership. It starts at the top -- it starts with the board of directors or the board of trustees
            understanding the value and urgency of digital transformation and how it can be leveraged. Leadership must
            champion the use of technology and almost insist or mandate that the institution leverage technology
            everywhere — from social media to the registrar’s office to the library.</p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>There’s Gold In Your Back Office</b></h4>
          <p>There’s no doubt that e-learning, massive open online courses and one-to-one computing is impressive
            change. However, do not overlook your back office and the massive benefits of digitally transforming
            internal operations. Automating routine tasks can change what your faculty, staff and administrators do
            every single day, resulting in efficiency improvements and extra time to focus on the aforementioned
            initiatives.</p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>Four Digital Transformation Initiatives</b></h4>
          <h5 class="margin-top-20"><b>Paperless</b></h5>
          <p>Paper-based processes are ubiquitous throughout educational institutions. Schools and universities use a
            tremendous amount of paper that gets routed through numerous departments and stages. Going paperless has
            significant benefits and creates amazing new digital experiences for your constituents and is an easy first
            step.
          </p>
          <h5 class="margin-top-20"><b>• Automate operations:</b></h5>
          <p>Considering the speed with which technology is impacting organizations of all sizes in all verticals, it
            is evident that educational institutions that fail to embrace digital transformation will be left behind in
            the upcoming years. Skyrocketing costs, unaffordable tuition and constrained budgets are putting extreme
            pressure on the modern educational system to invest in operational excellence to compete in a digitally
            transformed environment. Workflow automation, development operations, cloud and maximum digitization with
            minimum infrastructure must be your mantra.
          </p>
          <h5 class="margin-top-20"><b>Embrace Mobile:</b></h5>
          <p>Smartphones are the platform of choice of millennials. Mobility is bringing about bigger changes than the
            internet revolution. And in education, it is not an except.
          </p>
          <h5 class="margin-top-20"><b>• Harness the cloud:</b></h5>
          <p>Cloud is a vital cog in the wheel of digital transformation; moreover, it lays a foundation for the
            digital revolution in an organization. Cloud-delivered processes are crucial to enable mobility, speed and
            to address the skills gap. Cloud vendors have now built up years of experience and significant investments
            in delivering solutions that are reliable, scalable and secure. If you are looking for agility, efficiency,
            elasticity and cost optimization then adopting cloud is a must.
