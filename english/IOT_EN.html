          </h1>
          <br />

          <br />
          <h3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>
          <p><b>Internet Of Things (IoT)</b> - The Internet of Things seems to be in the forefront of a modern,
            civilized world. It’s a scenario where everything can be connected via the wireless Internet. Businesses
            are increasingly adopting IoT technology into production because of the potential market for innovation and
            lower production costs.<br>
            Seeing the fast-paced development of IoT technology products and the potential start-up technology market,
            this post provides IoT content with a coherence, fact, towards young people who have been and want to focus
            their energies on the Internet of Things. Desire to create unique products, creative, increasingly perfect
            and synchronized to meet the needs of life.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h3><b>WHAT IS INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) ?</b></h3>
          <p>
            <div class='col-sm-14'>
              <i>“Internet of Things (IoT) - The Internet of things is the network of physical devices, vehicles,
                home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network
                connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely
                identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing
                Internet infrastructure.” <br>
                <b>Link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things</a></b>
              </i>
            </div>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Internet of Things (IoT) refers to objects that can be identified as well as their existence in a
            connected, interconnected architecture: a network of things connected to the Internet, or simply Things.<br><br>
            IoT can be a sensor that is assembled in a refrigerator to record temperature, is a heart transplanted in
            the human body,…Understandably, IoT makes things easier to communicate with each other The biggest
            advantage of smart is the ability to prevent and warn anywhere.<br><br>
            The term "the Internet of things" was coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later MIT’s Auto-ID
            Center, in 1999, after that, it was used extensively in publications by manufacturers and analysts. They
            identified IoT as a complex system, because it contains many connections between machines, equipment and
            services. Initially, IoT was not meant to be automatic and intelligent. Later, it was thought to combine
            the two concepts IoT - Autonomous control together. It can observe change and feedback with the
            surroundings, also can control itself without network connection. Integrating intelligence into IoT can
            also help devices, machines and software collect and analyze human electronic data when we interact with
            them. In the future, people will be able to communicate with machines via wireless internet without any
            additional intermediaries.<br><br>
            The question is, what helps IoT "smart" and "understand" people? Initially, people thought that the
            Internet of things was primarily about M2M communication (devices connected via another device). But when
            it comes to "intelligence", It’s not just M2M communication that we need to mention the sensors. And do not
            be mistaken that the Sensor is a machine that operates under the control of other devices that are
            essentially similar to human eyes and ears with continuous recognition of measurements. After all, Internet
            of Things provides a connection between machines and sensors, and the cloud data to encrypt data. Cloud
            computing applications are the key to making Internet of Things work by analyzing, processing and using the
            data the sensors collect.<br><br>
            In the world today, the impact of the IOT is diverse and active in many areas: infrastructure management,
            health, construction and automation, transportation …. John Chambers (CEO of Cisco) announced: By 2024
            there will be 500 billion connected devices. In fact, this number is nearly 100 times greater than the
            number of people on Earth, That shows that things are more than people very much. We all know the IoT
            application can talk to people through the keyboard, and the device is also designed with more and more
            sensors to communicate in the fastest and most accurate way, it help to collect simple data from each of
            us. But most importantly, although it communicates with humans, the IoT application is not human. The
            people said that IoT is the key to success, it is the turning point and great opportunity of the future. In
            order not to fall behind, governments and businesses need to innovate and invest more aggressively in
            developing products that apply Internet of things technology.

          <br>
          <h3><b>IOT − KEY FEATURES</b></h3>
          <p>The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active
            engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>AI (Artifical Intelligence)</b> - IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it
                enhances every aspect of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms,
                and networks. This can mean something as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect
                when milk and your favorite cereal run low, and to then place an order with your preferred grocer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Connectivity</b> - New enabling technologies for networking, and specifically IoT networking, mean
                networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks can exist on a much smaller and
                cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these small networks between its system
                devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Sensors</b> - IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments which
                transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable of real-world
                integration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Active Engagement</b> - Much of today’s interaction with connected technology happens through
                passive
                engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product, or service engagement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Small Devices</b> - Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over
                time.
                IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h3><b>REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS OF INTERNET OF THINGS</b></h3>
          <p>To help clarify how the Internet of Things works, we’ve laid out some applications for the IoT, along with
            some specific devices and examples:</p>
          <center><img class="img-3" src="images/IoT/Predict.png"></center>
          <center><i>Predictably by 2020, the World will have some 50 billion IoT devices</i></center>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Smart Home</b> - According to statistics, smart home is the most searched IoT related applications
                on
                Google search. Smart Home is a home with lots of automatic features such as turn on the
                air-conditioner when you’re about to go home, turn off the lights when you leave the house, unlocking
                when your family member is at your door, Open the garage when you drive home from work… and other
                features that help improve the quality of life when using smart home.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Wearables</b> - Some of the devices, like the Dashbon Mask, this is a smart headphone. It’s help
                you
                listen to high quality music and watch HD movies with the virtual projector, or AMPL SmartBag a
                backpack with reserve cell that can charge for mobile devices, computers..</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Connected cars</b> - Help improve the quality of service for car users, a Connected car can
                optimize
                its operations such as reporting when low on fuel, giving alerts when things are approaching or most
                recently Tesla’s self-driving electric car…</p>
