          <h3>BIG DATA ANALYSIS</h3>
          <h4>Definition</h4>
          <p><b>Big data</b> often includes data sets of a size that far outstrip the capabilities of conventional software tools to collect, display, manage and process data for an acceptable period of time. Large data size is a constantly changing goal. As of 2012, the range is a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data. Large data requires a new set of techniques and technologies to be explored from diverse, complex, and large data sets</p>

          <br />
          <center><img class="img-2" src="images/big_data/bigdata1.jpg"></center>
          <p>
            <center><i>Wikipedia user activity is modeled and with terabytes in size, this can also be considered a Big Data form.</i></center>
          </p>


          <br />
          <h4>What can Big Data help us?</h4>
          <p>SAS says the real problem is not with the data you collect, but rather what you use Big Data for. In general, there are four benefits that Big Data can bring: cutting costs, reducing time, increasing development time and optimizing products, and helping people make the right decisions. More.</p>
          <p>If you pay a little attention, you will see when shopping online on eBay, Amazon or similar sites, this page will also offer the next hint for you, for example when viewing the phone, it will suggest for you to buy extra backs, extra batteries; When buying t-shirts, there are more suggestions for jeans, belts ... Therefore, the study of hobbies, habits of customers also indirectly help businesses sell more goods.</p>
          <p>So where does this information about habits and hobbies come from? It is from the huge amount of data that businesses collect as customers visit and interact with their site. It's not just the Big Data that will not only increase the profit for themselves but also increase the user's shopping experience. We can save more time with suggestions. rather than having to look for it yourself.</p>
          <p>End users like yourself and you will benefit from such optimization, but we ourselves are hard to develop ourselves or buy solutions to exploit Big Data because their cost is too expensive. , can be hundreds of thousands of dollars. In addition, the amount of data that we get is hard to see as "Big" if only a few Terabytes are born for a long time.</p>
          <p>A little overwhelmed, Big Data's application can help organizations predict government unemployment rates, future career trends to invest in those items, or cut back on spending. I like economic growth, and even a pre-epidemic prevention plan, like in the World War Z movie, Israel already knew the zombie epidemic and quickly built a wall. separated from the outside world.</p>
          <center><img class="img-2" src="images/big_data/bigdata2.jpg"></center>
          <br>
          <p>In 2009, Google used its Big Data data to analyze and predict the impact of the H1N1 flu pandemic. This service is called Google Flu Trends. The trend that Google draws from search terms related to the H1N1 flu has been very close to the results of two independent influenza alert systems, Sentinel GP and HealthStat. Flu Trends data is updated almost in real time and is then compared with data from disease centers in many parts of the world.</p>
          <h4>Featured</h4>
          <p>Big Data is characterized by the following characteristics:</p>
          <p><b>Volume</b></p>
          <p>The amount of data created and stored. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight- and whether it can actually be considered as large data.</p>
          <p><b>Variety</b></p>
          <p>Types and types of data. Data is collected from a variety of sources and data types also have a variety of structures.</p>
          <p><b>Velocity</b></p>
          <p>In this case, the speed of the data is created and processed to meet the needs and challenges of growth and development.</p>
          <p><b>Veracity (Authenticity)</b></p>
          <p>The quality of the data obtained can vary greatly, affecting the accuracy of the analysis. <br>
             Plants and non-virtualized systems may have a 6C system that includes:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Connectivity (sensor and network)</li>
            <li>Cloud (calculation and data on demand)</li>
            <li>Virtual content (templates and memory)</li>
            <li>Content / context (meaning and correlation)</li>
            <li>Community (sharing and collaborating)</li>
            <li>Custom (personalized and valuable)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Data must be processed using advanced tools (analysis and algorithms) to produce meaningful information. For example, to manage a plant must consider both tangible and intangible matters with different components. Information generation algorithms must detect and solve invisible problems such as machine degradation, component wear, etc. in a factory.</p>
          <h4>Technology</h4>
          <p>By 2015, large data will become prominent in business as a tool to help employees work more effectively as well as optimize data collection and sharing. The use of large data to solve data collection and IT issues in an enterprise is called IT Operations Analytics (ITOA). By applying large data principles to the notion of machine intelligence and deep computing, IT departments can predict potential problems and offer solutions before the problem arises. out. At this point, ITOA businesses have also begun to play an important role in managing the system by providing platforms that carry individual data and generate insights from the entire system. not from individual data.</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>EBay uses two data warehouse with 7.5 petabytes speed and 40PB 40PB as a cluster of Apache Hadoop to identify, recommend consumers and sales.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com handles millions of daily back-end operations, as well as queries from more than half a million third-party vendors. The core technology that Amazon operates on is Linux, and by 2005 they had three of the world's largest Linux databases, at 7.8 TB, 18.5 TB, and 24.7 TB.</li>
            <li>Facebook handles 50 billion images from its user base.</li>
            <li>Google processed about 100 billion searches a month in August 2012.</li>
            <li>The NoSQL Oracle Database was tested to pass the milestone of 1 million threads per second with 8 cores and reached a speed of 1.2 million threads per second with 10 cores.</li>
